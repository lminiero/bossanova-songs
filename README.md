Bossa Nova Chord Transcriptions
===============================

This repo doesn't contain any software, but just some [Chordpro](https://www.chordpro.org/) transcriptions of a few Bossa Nova songs I've studied recently.

# Motivation
Bossa Nova has been a love of mine for quite some time, but I only recently started delving a bit deeper in how to actually play those beautiful chords and the songs they make. Some of these songs I tried to transcribe myself by ear (and so they may or may not be accurate), while for others I relied on some other sources (there's a reference each time that happened). In order not to forget those transcriptions (Bossa Nova chords are TRICKY!), I decided to try and look for ways to write them down, and stumbled upon Chordpro, which renders them beautifully and allows matching to the lyrics as well, which I found helpful.

# Transcriptions
The list of transcriptions is limited, because I basically just transcribed some of the songs I loved that I've been studying myself recently. There's more that I'd like to be able to play, of course: I may add more in the future, if time (and limited guitar skills) permits. Rather than keep the resulting files to myself, I decided to share them in a repo instead. Hopefully these will be useful to other interested guitarists out there too, and why not, hopefully better players than me will suggest fixes to some of the transcriptions, or contribute others.

## Chordpro
The repo contains the Chordpro source files and, in the `pdf` folder, PDF files that I already rendered myself. In case you want to make changes to the files and want to re-render them, you can use the `build-pdfs.sh` script to regenerate them all, or just manually run `chordpro` on the `.cho` file you want to convert.

## Songs
This is a list of the files you'll find in the repo, with some info on the song, why I started studying it, and where the transcription comes from. They're not in alphabetical order, but rather mostly in the order I learned them.

| File | Song | Artist | Transcription Source | Motivation |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `fromthestart.cho` | From the start | Laufey | I used this very helpful [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhiCK06dlhw) to learn the song. | As I mentioned, I've been in love with Bossa Nova for ages, but it's only recently that the spark was re-ignited, and it was thanks to Laufey. Thanks to a recommendation on Mastodon, I listened to her "From the start" song, and immediately fell in love with it: a brand new song that is conquering charts, AND it's a Bossa Nova song one hundred percent?! I started studying it right away, and discovered that it wasn't that hard to play, despite the fact Bossa Nova chords can be intimidating. It's this effort that basically convinced me to move further and study other songs too.  |
| `nothingtolose.cho` | Nothing to lose | Claudine Longet | Mostly by ear | This song may not be strictly speaking considered Bossa Nova, but it has that vibe so I always thought of it like that. It's a song, written by Henri Mancini for Claudine Longet, that can be heard in the "Hollywood Party" movie with Peter Sellers, where Claudine herself plays and sings it for the audience in the movie. It's a mesmerizing song that I've loved since the first time I heard it forever ago, and so, emboldened as I was by the success in playing "From the start", I decided to tackle it too. At first I tried looking for existing chord transcriptions online, but they were all painfully inaccurate, so I decided to try and find out the chords by ear instead. I've always had a good ear for chords, but with Bossa Nova it's easy getting close but not close enough: I'm personally happy with how it came, so I stuck with those. |
| `thegirlfromipanema.cho` | The Girl from Ipanema | Astrud Gilberto, Joao Gilberto, Stan Getz | I used this [excellent tutorial by Rick Beato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuEa03KJIgs) to learn the song.  | When you think of Bossa Nova, "The Girl from Ipanema" can't but pop to mind _immediately_, and with good reason: it's super-famous and a gorgeous song too. When I stumbled on this tutorial by Rick Beato, I delved in it right away to learn. Rick does an excellent job of simplifying the study process in term of plain chord shapes you need to learn, and then apply at different roots. This made the song so much easier to learn, and rewarding to play! |
| `manhadecarnaval.cho` | Manha de Carnaval | Joao Gilberto | Mostly inspired by this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-f7hiEhWc) | "Manha de Carnaval" is a song originally written by Luiz Bonf√°, but I like Joao Gilberto's version so much more: it's slower, sweeter, more intense, and I love every second of it. Looking around I found a video by Christophe Rousseau where he breaks down (in real-time, while he gos through the process himself!) the different chords that make the song. It's a fantastic video, as you can see him try different shapes and different positions for the chords, or highlighting the note that really must be heard. It's all in Portuguese, which I don't speak, but nevertheless the process is easy to understand anyway. Eventually I didn't use all the same exact chords he found, since to simplify things I sometimes used slightly different chords (often because they were just easier to play for me), but it's still good enough to my ear, and I love playing it. |
| `sonetodoamortotal.cho` | Soneto do Amor Total | Vinicius de Moraes, Quarteto em Cy | By ear | This is one of my favourite songs ever: very short, and just as emotional. In the version by Quarteto em Cy", it's basically the poem narrated while their beautiful voices play a gorgeous soundscape in the background. The chord progression is just so beautiful. As I did with "Nothing to lose", I first tried looking for existing chord transcriptions, found there was nothing useful, and so did it by ear instead. |
| `meupanama.cho` | Meu Panama | Toquinho | By ear | Another personal favourite: most Bossa Nova songs tend to be mellow, relaxing and emotional, but "Meu Panama" is a very uplifting song instead, and one that's great to sing along to! It's the first song I learned in 2024 (the day after New Year's Eve), so I'm particularly proud of the completely-by-ear transcription! |
| `haunted.cho` | Haunted | Laufey | By ear | I explained how I fell in Laufey after earing "From the start": the whole "Bwitched" album is actually very impressive, and I've listened to it countless times (so many times that I was gifted the vinyl for Christmas!). Most other songs fall more in a pop/jazz kind of genre, but Haunted is closer to Bossa Nova in vibe, especially in how guitar chords are played rhythmically. Since I was now more familiar with some of the most common Bossa Nova chords, I tried doing this by ear too, and to my surprise it was quit easy. Looking at some videos Laufey has on her YouTube channels, some of the chords I chose are different from the ones she actually uses, but since they sound accurate enough to me, I left them as I found them. |
